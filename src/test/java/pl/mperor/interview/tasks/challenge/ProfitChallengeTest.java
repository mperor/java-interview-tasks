/**
 * Profit Challenge ðŸ”¢
 *
 * <p>Have the function <i>ArrayChallenge(arr)</i> take the array of numbers stored in {@code arr} which will contain integers that represent the amount in dollars that a single stock is worth,
 * and return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying stock on day x and selling stock on day y where y>x.
 *
 * <p>For example: if {@code arr} is <i>[44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15]</i> then your program should return 16
 * because at index 2 stock was worth $24 and at index 6 the stock was then worth $40, so if you bought the stock at 24 and sold it at 40,
 * you would have made a profit of $16, which is the maximum profit that could have been made with this list of stock prices.
 *
 * <p>If there is no profit that could have been made with the stock prices, then your program should return -1.
 * For example: {@code arr} is <i>[10, 9, 8, 2]</i> then your program should return -1.
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b>
 *
 * <p>Input: <i>new int[] {10,12,4,5,9}</i>
 * <p>Output: <i>5</i>
 *
 * <p>Input: <i>new int[] {14,20,4,12,5,11}</i>
 * <p>Output: <i>8</i>
 *
 * <p>Input: <i>new int[] {44,30,24,32,35,30,40,38,15}</i>
 * <p>Output: <i>16</i></p>
